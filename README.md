# About Me

Hi, I’m **Views** an engineering student passionate about technology, robotics, and creating opportunities where they don’t exist. 

After facing numerous internship rejections from companies worldwide, I decided to turn that experience into something positive and impactful.

That’s why I founded **Viewstech Community** — a platform designed to provide students like me with real-world projects, collaborative experiences, and a chance to build something meaningful that can be recognized globally.  
If the doors don’t open for us, we build our own.

This repository is a little window into who I am, what I stand for, and the projects I’m proud of.
